          MovieHub is strictly for adults 18 years of age or older. We take age verification seriously and implement multiple verification methods:

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Initial Age Gate:</strong> All users must confirm they are 18+ before accessing any content</li>
          <li><strong>Account Registration:</strong> Age verification required during account creation</li>

          <li><strong>Periodic Re-verification:</strong> We may request re-verification to maintain account access</li>
          <li><strong>Content Warnings:</strong> Explicit age warnings displayed on all content pages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18. If we discover that we have collected information from a minor, we will immediately delete such information and terminate the account. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has accessed our service, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:legal@moviehub.com" class="legal-link">legal@moviehub.com</a>.
